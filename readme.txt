A personal collection of useful functions for WordPress plugins and themes.

== Description ==

A personal collection of useful functions for WordPress plugins and themes.

= Functions for plugins =

Add the following code to the main plugin file:

`add_action('plugins_loaded', function(){`
`    if(did_action('ldc_functions')){`
`        'Add your custom code here...';`
`    }`
`});`

= Functions for themes =

Create a new file named `ldc-functions.php` and add your custom code there or add the following code to the functions.php file:

`if(did_action('ldc_functions')){`
`    'Add your custom code here...';`
`}`

Note that `after_ldc_functions` is the **first action hook available to themes**, instead of `after_setup_theme`.
