== Description ==

A collection of functions for WordPress plugins and themes.

= For plugin developers: =

Add the following code to your main plugin file:

`add_action('plugins_loaded', function(){`
`    if(did_action('ldc_functions')){`
`        'Add your custom code here...';`
`    }`
`});`

= For theme developers: =

Add the following code to your `functions.php` file or create a new file named `ldc-functions.php`:

`if(did_action('ldc_functions')){`
`    'Add your custom code here...';`
`}`

Note that `after_ldc_functions` is the **first action hook available to themes**, instead of `after_setup_theme`.
